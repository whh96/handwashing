# Handwashing impact on maternal birthing survivability 
I got this project idea from datacamp and the data sets from kaggle. 

# <h3>This project introduced me to data cleaning and visualization in R. 
  
<h3>I used data manipulation techniques as well as the ggplot library to visualize the impact that handwashing had on maternal death.

<h3>I was able to visualize the difference in the mortality reate between two clinics where one washed handds and the other did not.
