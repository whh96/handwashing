# handwashing
I got this project idea from datacamp and the data sets from kaggle. 

I like how the project turned out but I think I would have liked to figure out how to make the graph for when handwashing began a little more appealing. 
I couldn't figure out how to change the x axis to just display the year and tick marks for months so it ended up being squished together and unreadable.




Overall, I am satisfied with the conclusion I came to. Who would have thought that handwashing would prevent deaths?
